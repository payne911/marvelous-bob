# Server
Server-side application for Marvelous Bob game.

## To launch the server locally (for devs)
The ``.run`` folder at the root of the repository contains a few IntelliJ ``Run Configuration``.

If you open the project in IntelliJ, you will automatically have your Run Configurations set up: simply launch `[SERVER] Local`.

## AWS
Listing the services and resources used so that we can easily go back and clean everything, eventually.

**[Free-Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)** started on: **17 february 2020** (it lasts 12 months)

**Region**: Canada -> **`ca-central-1`**

### ECS configuration
Initial set up was done through following [this tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/getting-started-ecs-ec2.html).
 
Then, to customize the set up to work with GitHub Actions, the following changes were made:

  1. Changed the ``containerPort`` of `PortMapping` from ``80`` to ``80``.
  2. Removed the ``commands`` that was setting up a default HTML page to land on.
  3. Updated the ``entryPoint`` to match a jar execution: `java, -jar, /app.jar`.
  4. Edit the ``build.gradle`` file so that jars do not include version numbers and include Shadow plugin.
  5. Add a ``Dockerfile`` which extends our JDK (alpine version) and copies the generated jar.
  6. Added a ``workingDirectory`` value of `/`.
  7. Changed the ``image`` to point toward our Docker Hub repository.
  8. Enforced the ``requiresCompatibilities`` to be `EC2`.
  9. The minimum healthy percentage modified from ``100%`` to `0%`, and maximum from `200%` to `100%`: this is to ensure that we can kill a running task and then start a new one, and never have more than 1 task in the Container. See [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/40741816/9768291) SO answer to understand better.

## CI/CD
Done through GitHub Actions: deploying a Docker image into our public Docker Hub repository, and updating the ECS stack subsequently.

The Dockerfile looks for the result of calling the ``shadowJar`` on this current module (``server``).
